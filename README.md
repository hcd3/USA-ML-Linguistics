## About

Despite all speaking the same language, there is a vast amount of variety in the continental United
States in our lingustic tendencies and what we call day-to-day items!  As you take this quiz, data collected
from the [Harvard Dialect Survey](http://dialect.redlog.net/maps.html) helps train
the Machine Learning model to predict whether you are from the **Northeast**, **South**, **Midwest**, or 
**Pacific/Rockies**.
